               Welcome to MSC Nastran 2024.2
  
   MSC Nastran brings powerful new features and enhancements for engineering
   solutions in several releases through the year. Key enhancements in
   Version 2024.2 are summarized below. Addtional details can be found in
   the MSC Nastran Version 2024.2 Release Guide.
  
     MSC Nastran 2024.2 Features and Enhancements
  
     High Performance Computing (HPC) for NVH
     - Improved performance for ACMS, especially for large solid models
     - Improved performance for FASTFR, particularly when structural
       damping is present
     - General performance improvement for high frequency acoustics
     - Improved diagnostics for linear solution available in LOG file
       Information includes solver selection and memory use
  
     Topology Optimization
     - SOL 200 NEO Topology Optimization for generative design with support for
       manufacturing constraints. Optimized CAD geometry and mesh output for
       every design cycle.
  
     High Performance SOL 400 (NLPERF)
     - Support Lagrange Multiplier for MPC and Rigid Elements
     - Controls distributed surface load computation for shell elements with
       offsets and the use of an additional enhancement for computing the
       average nodal normal vector
     - GPFORCE and ESE can be requested in ANALYSIS=NLSTAT
     - OUTCTRL={STD,SOLUTION,INTERM} keyword in NLOPRM case control statement is
       available
  
     Linear
     - Global-Local analysis in SOL 101 and 103. Creates a local model based on
       a user-provided definition (CARVE) and replaces the rest of the model
       with an external superelement. Allows for detailed local studies without
       having to solve the entire model every time.
     - Multiple Output requests of the same result item in linear solutions
       (SOL 101, 103, 108, 109, 111, 112) through the use of repeated output
       request subcase, REPCASE.
  
     NVH (Vibroacoustics)
     Automated skinning of solid elements free surfaces
     - Identify residual structure solid elements' exposed surfaces, and create
       required triangular or quadilateral shell elements on top of it
     - Stress and strain data recovery available for skinned shell elements
     - Supported in Linear solution sequences
     Acoustic Fluid Grid Participation Factors from fluid skin grids in touch
       with either structure wetted surface or trim components
1    Mass matrix support in Cohesive elements
     - supports mass matrix in cohesive elements for glue line modeling.
     Improved solution time and reduced disk space for Nastran-PEM models
  
     Aeroelasticity
     - Flutter Perturbation Step available in SOL 400 Nonlinear
  
     HDF5 hybrid precision output file
     - Allows writing of 32-bit real and 64-bit integer data to H5 file
     - Combines small size of 32-bit and high value domain ID of 64-bit
  
      Inertia Relief with External Superelements
     - For external superelements, inertia relief is now supported for the
       following three options: EXTSEOUT MATDB(MATRIXDB), EXTSEOUT DMIGDB, and
       EXTSEOUT DMIGOP2 for INREL = -1 and INREL = -2.
     - For the above three external superelement options, checks are now
       performed internally to insure that the inertia relief specifications
       between external superelement and the assembly run are consistent.
     - When verifying results, the user is reminded that with inertia relief,
       the displacements are relative displacements and may not in any way match
       the results of say a model containing all the external superelements
       processed as standard part superelements. However, element results
       such as force or stress should match closely between the two types of runs
       if consistently modeled.
